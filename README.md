# FTC-CenterStage-ScoringAlgorithm
A scoring algorithm I made a few years ago for the CenterStage FTC season. It is supposed to determine the optimal place for a "pixel" on the "backdrop" based on that pixel's color and the current setup of the "backdrop." I did not get to test it during the season as we had trouble with the cameras.
